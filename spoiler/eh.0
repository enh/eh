NAME

    eh - Edit Here - vi(1) the good parts version


SYNOPSIS

    eh [filename]


DESCRIPTION

    Create or read a text file to edit.  Text files consists of lines of
    printable ASCII text, tabs, or newline characters.  A physical line
    can be of arbitrary length and is delimited by either a newline or
    the end of file.  Tab stops are every eight columns.  The behaviour
    of non-printable characters may vary depending on the implementation
    of the Curses library, `stty(1)` settings, or terminal emulator.


COMMANDS

    The commands a similar, but not the same as `vi(1)`.  Most commands
    can be prefixed by a repeat count, eg. `5w`, `123G`, `2dw` (`d2w`),
    or `2d3w` (`d6w`).  Motion commands, optionally prefixed by a count,
    are those that move the cursor without modifying the buffer.

    h j k l     Left, down, up, right cursor movement.
    H J K L     Page top, page down, page up, page bottom.
    ^F ^B       Page down, page up
    b w         Word left, word right.
    ^ $         Start and end of line.
    |           Goto column (count) of physical line.
    /ERE        Find first occurrence of ERE pattern after the cursor.
    /ERE/REPL   Find ERE and replace.  In the `REPL`, a `$n` where `n` is
                a digit `0..9` is replaced by the nth subexpression of the
                matched text; `$0` is the whole matched text. `\x` is a
                an escape sequence, ie. \a \b \e \f \n \r \t \? or `x`.
    m char      Set a positional mark letter a..z.
    n           Find next occurrence of ERE (and replace); see `u`.
    ` char      Goto position of mark `a .. `z or `` (previous).
    ' char      Goto start of line with mark 'a .. 'z or '' (previous).
    G           Goto line (count) number; 1G top of file, G bottom.
    \           Toggle text selection.
    d motion    Delete text selection or region given by motion.
    y motion    Yank (copy) text selection or region given by motion.
    P p         Paste last deleted or yanked text region before or after
                the cursor.
    i a         Insert text mode before or after the cursor, ESC or CTRL+C
                ends insert.  While inserting text, backspace will erase
                the previous character; CTRL+V treats the next character
                as a literal character.
    X x         Delete character before or after cursor, ie. `dh` or `dl`.
    u           Undo last modification, except invert case.
    ~           Invert character case.
    ! motion    Filter text selection or region through command(s), eg.
                `!fmt -w68`. Or read only the output of a command, eg.
                `!!ls -l`.
    R           Read a file into buffer after cursor.
    W           Write buffer to file.
    Q           Quit.
    CTRL+C      Quit.

    Any other key will redraw the screen.
